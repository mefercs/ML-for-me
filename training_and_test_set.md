# Training data sets

If we have only a data set, we can trim it, trying to give a larger set to train the data, and a smaller to the test set.
- Divide into two sets:
  - training set
  - test set
Classic gotcha: do not train on test data
  - Getting surprisingly low loss?
  - Before celebrating, check if you're accidentally training on test data
